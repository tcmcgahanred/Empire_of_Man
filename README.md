# Cybersecurity Homelab and Threat Range

This project documents the architecture, design, and phased execution of a home-based cyber range, hosted on a Dell PowerEdge R640 and virtualized using VMware. It combines a traditional blue team lab, an offensive test range, and passive home network monitoring while preserving strict segmentation from personal and family systems.

---

## 🌟 Project Goals

- Build a modular, virtualized cybersecurity lab for blue/red team training
- Monitor and analyze home network traffic safely
- Segregate the family LAN, gaming PC, and cyber lab securely
- Enable remote lab access using a hardened AWS jump server
- Integrate TheHive and Cortex as the SOAR platform
- Document all deployments, configurations, and security boundaries using Git

## 🧱 Physical & Virtual Infrastructure

### Server
- **Dell PowerEdge R640**
  - Dual Xeon CPUs
  - 64–128GB RAM
  - Quad-port i350 NIC
  - VMware ESXi hypervisor

### Networking
- pfSense VM (core firewall/router)
- Virtual switches and VLANs inside VMware
- Optional: Managed physical switch for VLAN trunking later

### Key VLANs
| VLAN ID | Purpose            |
|---------|--------------------|
| 10      | Lab Clients        |
| 20      | Lab Servers        |
| 30      | DMZ (Honeypots)    |
| 40      | C2/Red Team Net    |
| 50      | Gaming PC VLAN     |
| 100     | Home LAN (isolated)|

### Key VMs
- pfSense
- Windows 10 / 11 endpoints
- Active Directory & DNS
- Kali Linux (Red Team)
- Security Onion (IDS/NIDS)
- Wazuh (SIEM)
- TheHive (Case Management)
- Cortex (SOAR Automation)
- Range Admin Workstation (internal jump VM)

---

## 🌐 Segmentation Strategy

- **Home network**: Isolated, monitored only via SPAN port or passive TAP
- **Gaming rig**: On separate VLAN (50), no lab access; no lab tooling or scanning allowed
- **Lab range**: Internal VLANs routed and firewalled by pfSense
- **Remote access**: AWS EC2 jump box (Ubuntu or Windows Server), hardened and optionally VPN-connected to lab

---

## 🔐 Security Practices

- pfSense as centralized access control (stateful firewall rules per VLAN)
- pfBlockerNG for known-bad IP/DNS blocking
- Suricata (via Security Onion) for active threat detection
- No shared infrastructure or tooling between personal and lab systems
- Admin access from dedicated VM or cloud jump box only
