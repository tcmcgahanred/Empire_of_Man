## [2025-05-08] Phase 1 Complete – ESXi Deployment + Lab Network Segmentation

- Mounted Dell PowerEdge R640 into Vevor open-frame rack  
- iDRAC9 configured via USB with static IP 192.168.4.120/24, gateway 192.168.4.1  
- Service Tag: GKSH1S2  
- Updated firmware via iDRAC:
  - SAS-RAID: SAS-RAID_Firmware_700GG_WN64_25.5.9.0001_A17_01  
  - iDRAC: iDRAC-with-Lifecycle-Controller-Firmware_RVDDR_WN64_7.00.00.181_A00  
  - BIOS: BIOS_J6D53_WN64_2.23.0  
- Created RAID 10 virtual disk across 4 drives using PERC H730P
- Installed VMware ESXi 8.0 Update 2 (Dell-custom ISO)  
- ESXi host static IP: 192.168.4.40  
- Hostname: Lionsgate ([https://Lionsgate/](https://Lionsgate/))  
- DNS: Primary 8.8.8.8, Alternate 1.1.1.1  
- Created secondary ESXi admin account: `custodian`  
- Management network isolated using vSwitch0 → `vmnic0` → Eero

### vSwitch-palace (Segmented Lab Virtual Switch)
- Created `vSwitch-palace` with no uplinks
- Created VLAN-tagged port groups:
  - PG-VLAN10 (vlan10) – Lab Clients
  - PG-VLAN20 (vlan20) – Lab Servers
  - PG-VLAN30 (vlan30) – DMZ
  - PG-VLAN40 (vlan40) – Red Team
  - PG-Custodes (vlan100) – Admin / CustodianNet
- Enabled promiscuous mode, MAC address changes, and forged transmits on VLANs 10–40
- PG-Custodes remained locked down (no promiscuous mode enabled)

### pfSense Prep
- Downloaded pfSense CE AMD64 ISO from Netgate ([https://www.pfsense.org/download/](https://www.pfsense.org/download/))
- Used 7-Zip to extract .gz-compressed installer ISO
- Deployed new VM `Rogal_Dorn` for pfSense
- Initially added 5 NICs for PG-VLAN10, 20, 30, 40, and PG-Custodes
- Attempted interface assignment with vmx0 (00:0c:29:40:2b:f8) but ran into installer limitations

---

## [2025-05-09] Rollback to Simplified Lab Core

- Removed unused NICs from `Rogal_Dorn` VM to simplify setup
- Retained 3 NICs:
  - NIC 1 → PG-Custodes (vlan100) → MAC: 00:0c:29:40:2b:f8
  - NIC 2 → PG-VLAN10 (vlan10) → MAC: 00:0c:29:40:2b:02
  - NIC 3 → VM Network (default on vSwitch0) → MAC: 00:0c:29:40:2b:0c
- Rebuilt pfSense using two-NIC layout for core functionality:
  - WAN → VM Network (via vSwitch0)
  - LAN → PG-VLAN10 (Lab Clients)
- Used VM Network MAC 00:0c:29:40:2b:0c for WAN
- Used PG-VLAN10 MAC 00:0c:29:40:2b:02 for LAN
- Completed pfSense CE installation successfully and reached initial configuration wizard
- Skipped cloud-based Netgate services and proceeded with local-only configuration
- Verified LAN connectivity to 192.168.1.1 from VLAN10

### Active Network Configuration

**vSwitch0 (Management & WAN)**
- Connected to `vmnic0` (Eero LAN)
- Port groups:
  - VM Network (active WAN interface for pfSense)
  - PG-WAN (VLAN 60, created for future use)

**vSwitch-palace (Segmented Lab)**
- PG-VLAN10 (vmx3 → 00:0c:29:40:2b:02)
- PG-Custodes (vmx1 → 00:0c:29:40:2b:f8)

Absolutely, Archmagos. Below is a structured and professionally formatted `changelog.md` entry documenting today’s sacred work on the *Emperor\_of\_Mankind* node and the broader STC-SOCaaS\_v1 prototype.

---

## 🪐 `changelog.md` — 2025-05-12

### **Subject:** Provisioning of *Emperor\_of\_Mankind* (SOCaaS Admin Node)

---

### 🧱 **Infrastructure Events**

* Verified `pg-custodes` port group mapping in ESXi.
* Identified initial networking failure due to *Rogal\_Dorn* not being powered on.
* Corrected VM network segmentation:

  * Reassigned one of *Rogal\_Dorn*'s NICs from `pg-vlan10` to `pg-custodes`.
  * Reassigned pfSense’s LAN interface to this NIC and confirmed it was set to `10.0.10.1/24`.
* Brought *Emperor\_of\_Mankind* online with a static IP (`10.0.10.10`) via Netplan using modern route syntax.

---

### 🔧 **Ubuntu Workstation Stabilization**

* Resolved black screen issue post-install by using `nomodeset` kernel parameter in GRUB.
* Made `nomodeset` permanent to ensure graphical session stability.
* Installed `open-vm-tools` and `open-vm-tools-desktop` to restore clipboard and display integration.

---

### 🔐 **Provisioning Script: `provision.sh`**

* Authored and executed a full provisioning script to baseline the system.
* Major actions:

  * Updated system packages.
  * Installed essential tooling (e.g., curl, git, zsh, ufw, fail2ban).
  * Set hostname to `Emperor_of_Mankind` and updated `/etc/hosts`.
  * Created hardened admin user `malcador-the-sigillite`.
  * Disabled root SSH login and password-based auth.
  * Configured UFW to allow only SSH inbound.
  * Enabled `fail2ban` for brute-force protection.
* Script enhanced with `tee` logging to `~/Desktop/hardening_log.txt`.

---

### 🔑 **SSH Key Setup Script: `setup_ssh_key.sh`**

* Authored a companion script to install an SSH public key for `malcador-the-sigillite`.
* Script includes:

  * `.ssh` directory creation
  * `authorized_keys` setup
  * Proper permissions and ownership enforcement
  * Clear comments for deferred use

---

### 🧠 **Knowledge Notes**

* Confirmed:

  * Ubuntu usernames must follow `NAME_REGEX` rules: lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes only.
  * `gateway4` is deprecated in Netplan; replaced with `routes: - to: default via: x.x.x.x`.
  * `nomodeset` disables GPU driver loading, avoiding crashes, but also disables dynamic resolution.

---

### 🗂️ **Artifacts Created**

* `provision.sh` – full provisioning and hardening script
* `setup_ssh_key.sh` – SSH key installation script for admin account
* `hardening_log.txt` – log of provisioning actions (created at runtime)

---

Let me know if you'd like this saved as a file now (`changelog.md`) or appended into a central documentation repository as your prototype expands.


## 📜 `changelog.md` — Cumulative Update (Since Last Logged)

### **Coverage Period:** From Last Changelog Request → 2025-05-20

---

### 🧱 Infrastructure Changes

* Verified functional ESXi 8.0.2 installation on Dell PowerEdge R640
* Mounted and configured pfSense VM (Rogal\_Dorn) with WAN and LAN interfaces:

  * WAN: 192.168.4.187 (via VM Network)
  * LAN: 10.0.10.1 (via pg-custodes)
* Configured and validated pfSense DHCP, firewall, and interface rules
* Successfully segmented LAN-side traffic via `vSwitch-palace` and `pg-custodes`
* Confirmed VM `Emperor_of_Mankind` has full IP and DNS reachability via pfSense

---

### ⚙️ Git & Documentation Enhancements

* Reorganized GitHub repo (`Empire_of_Man`) with the following folder structure:

  * `configs/` (subfolders: Appliances, Networking, VMs)
  * `diagrams/` (for .drawio and .png topology maps)
  * `playbooks/`, `Security/`, `logs/`, and `dependencies/`
* Added README structural section to describe all directories and their function
* Wrote detailed `README.md` and `configs/README.md` for component tracking and configuration
* Created `COMPONENTS.md` and asset tables for:

  * Implemented VMs
  * Software appliances
  * Installed blue team tooling on analyst workstation

---

### 🛡️ Strategic Decisions

* Chose not to route all home traffic through pfSense
* Retained Eero mesh system as primary home network routing layer
* Designated pfSense for lab-side segmentation and future VLAN control only

---

### 🧪 Detection & Visibility Direction

* Selected **agent-based telemetry model** (Wazuh agents) instead of passive wire mirroring
* Deferred Security Onion deployment to later phase
* Chose to install Wazuh manager on internal VM and deploy Wazuh agents to:

  * `Emperor_of_Mankind`
  * Future test systems and optionally external clients
* Telemetry strategy designed to minimize infrastructure disruption

---

### 🧠 Launch Automation

* Built PowerShell script `Launch-SOCaaS.ps1` to automate:

  * Opening Git repo folder
  * Launching VS Code in project context
  * Opening ChatGPT in browser
  * Opening ESXi host interface ([https://192.168.4.40](https://192.168.4.40))
* Integrated Windows Text-to-Speech voice cue:

  > "All systems online, Archmagos. The Emperor protects."
* Created `.vbs` wrapper (`Launch-SOCaaS.vbs`) to silently execute `.ps1` script (later reverted)
* Final decision: run `.ps1` directly from desktop

---

### 🎨 Miscellaneous & Support Tools

* Created draw\.io network topology diagram for current environment
* Discussed router upgrade options; deferred Eero replacement
* Clarified differences between port groups and VLANs in ESXi
* Validated pfSense routing between vmx0 and vmx1 interfaces
* Confirmed physical NIC-to-vSwitch-to-VM mappings on ESXi

---

### ✅ Current State

* Core components active:

  * Dell R640
  * pfSense (Rogal\_Dorn)
  * Ubuntu Analyst Node (Emperor\_of\_Mankind)
* Git, VS Code, and workflow automation operational
* Lab is telemetry-ready for Wazuh deployment
* System start script tested and functional
